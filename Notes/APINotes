API - Application programming interface

Client - the one who send the request
server - the one who respond to the request
API - communicates in between client and server
Request - send by client (information asked)
Response - (Answer from the server/DB)



Presentation layer - it is front-end/UI which we see on the screen
Application layer/Business layer - it is a layer where the logic of the application has been written
Data layer - it is the layer where data exists or we call it Database


Client - Server architecture



presentation layer - client exist


Application layer - logic exist of the application
Data layer - data exist



1 - tier architecture
when presentation layer, application layer, data layer available at one place, we call it 1 - tier architecture.

examples = calculator, MS word, MS paint, desktop based application/ standalone application.

2 - tier architecture

when the presentation layer is available at client end and the application and data layer is available at server end, we call it 2-tier architecture.
pizza hut, dominos, subway, walmart, starbucks etc

3 tier - architecture

when the presentation layer is available at client end
application layer is available at another end
and data layer is availablae at third end

example - JD parts, local bank, syntax hrm




n-tier architecture

presentation layer
application layer
data layer

example - Amazon, FB, IG, Twitter etc

Why do we need API?

-- to make the systems developed in different languages communicate

-- to maintain the security of the data among the applications



Details we need to perform api testing


the location of api - end point

End point - it helps us in getting specific information from bunch of information


Early form testing(Early Stage Testing)- database testing and then API testing before UI is completed to save time





Web services -

API's which are hosted over the internet are called web services


every web services is an API by-default


why do we need to test -
to find the glitch in the system



2 types of web services -

REST - representational state transfer
SOAP - simple object access protocol


90% REST -

we will learn and work with REST API

Documents we need to perform testing
for UI - SRS (Software requirement specification)
for API = Swagger


to perform API testing;
API location - end point
Examples:
Adress - specific item
Airline - specific flight
Amazon - specfic type of user


API Location= Base URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
	      URL(Uniform Resource Locator)


provide these to perform API testing;
Base URI
End point - to get specific information from group of information

URL+endpont -- to get the data, it becomes base URI (API exact location to fetch the details)


HTTP - hypertext transfer protocol
it is a protocol which allows websites to communicate over the internet

some basic methods of http, which we need to follow
C - POST
R - GET
U - PUT
D - DELETE

First request -

Create Admin user into the system--
Base URI = Base URL+endpoint

Base URI - hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/createUser.php

payload/body - here we send the data which we need to add in the database
JSON - key and value - we use JSON format to send the payload/body
Body -
{
  "name": "Batch14G8",
  "email": "codingAvengers@test.com",
  "password": "CodingAvengers123
}

content type - application/json
Type of request -POST

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 3-
recap
What is webservices
Rest
Soap
HTTP -
it has some methods to perform specific operations.
C - create - POST
R - retrieve - GET
U - Update - PUT
D - delete - DELETE
Example of the house - For Base URI.
base url endpoint
base URL= base URL + end paint
Swagger -developer provide this document
POST method -
To prepare the-request.
Base URI-
Body /payload - available in json Format (key and value).
Type of methal - POST content type -application /json
Response -201 status code
POSTMAN -
in the body provide all the keys which are available in Swagger document, Don’t Delete/Add any additional key
2 types of API
- public
- private
Public example -nbascores



2 types of API -
1)Public = live footballscores use public API/ nbascores
2)Private  - majority of the applications use private API


API keeps the security
HOW?

process of authentication and authorization we have in API
we will work mainly with private API -


in private APIs, we have 2 types of application
1) Stateful application - amazon, instagram, facebook where credentials are saved
It is the application where state of the server memory is TRUE
This application stores the session id in server memory
Everytime, a user makes a request, he has to send the credentials but if it is stored in server memory, he doesn't need to provide these details multiple times.
examples: amazon, instagram, facebook etc.

2) Stateless Application -
When the state of the server is FALSE, it is stateless application.
Everytime response will be passed to the client or user in terms of token.
Stateless is more secure than statefull application.


Create a request to generate a token

base URI= hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/generateToken.php
Type of Method = POST
payload/body -
{
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string"
}
content-type  - application/json


Response - 200 status code
Jason Web Token - JWT

eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.
eyJpYXQiOjE2NzM3MTc3NjYsImlzcyI6ImxvY2FsaG9zdCIsImV4cCI6MTY3Mzc2MDk2NiwidXNlcklkIjoiNDc0NSJ9.
VR2bcBnUqAowe55u-hhjZM15iLi_n49BuMOMhKqkM54

JWT Token has 3 parts

part 1 - header - type of token, algorithm used to create a token
part 2 - payload - issuer, issue time, expiry date, userID
part 3 - signature - same message has been conveyed to the client

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

so far, we created an admin user and generated a token which we will use to perform CRUD operations

CREATE A NORMAL EMPLOYEE

Base URI - hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/createEmployee.php

type of method - POST

payload/body -
{
  "emp_firstname": "Aram",
  "emp_lastname": "Lango",
  "emp_middle_name": "ms",
  "emp_gender": "M",
  "emp_birthday": "2010-01-14",
  "emp_status": "confirmed",
  "emp_job_title": "QA Engineer"
}

headers -
content-type = application/json

JWT token has 3 types - bearer, MAC, grants

THUMB RULE - after create an employee, cross check it
	     after updating an employee, cross check it
	     after deleting an employee, cross check it









gender is missing?
Possible cases:
Either database has not added gender
Either database added it but API for create an employee is not able to show it

while calling the method when we use snippet, here pm stands for postman object



path parameter
Whatever comes with / we call them path parameter
query parameter

2 types of API -
Public API -
Private API -
john - 9.19, how people hack the system,I NEED TO ANSWER THIS TODAY ITSELF
AND GIVE AN EXAMPLE FOR ANTON 9.20
API keeps the security
HOW -
process of authentication and authorization
We will work mainly with private API -
in private API's we have 2 types of application
Stateful application -
it is the application where the state of the server memory is true
this application stores the session id in server memory
every time a user makes a request, he has to send the credentials but if
it is stored in server memory, he
doesn't need to provide this details
examples - amazon, instagram, facebook etc
Stateless application -
when the state of the server memory is false, it is stateless application
everytime response will be passed to the client/user in terms of token
statless is more secure than stateful application
CREATE A REQUEST TO GENERATE A TOKEN
base URI - hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/generateToken.php
Type of method - POST

authorization and authentication
who are you
are you allowed?
show your id
what access you have
Stateful application -

Get job titles
Type of request - GET
Base URI = hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/jobTitle.php
Authorization - token
Update employee -

{
"employee_id": "46151A",
"emp_birthday": "2000-01-12"
}
header - content-type
authorization - token
in put we get 200 - it replaces whole data and not adding anything new
in patch we get 201 because we add a patch here in the existing data
Delete an employee
Type of request - Delete
Base uri =  hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/apiâ/deleteEmployee.php
employee_id
cookies - it is a small block of code created by a web server while a user
is browsing a website or application
on the computer, it is saving the activity.
why cookies use?
track your information  - for advertisement purpose
remeber your information
in house API - for internal use
third party API - for selling purpose
DEV
QA
STAGING
PRODUCTION
Test case
create an employee
get the created employee
verify it
update the employee
get the updated employee
update partial details of the employee
get this employee
Tests has been written in Javascript language
while calling the method when we use snippet, here pm stands for postman
object
here we use chai assertion library from where we call our test
whatever comes with ? we call them query parameter
whatever comes with / we call them path parameter
Class 5 -
recap -
Json format we use to convert response body into json format
to extract/retrieve any specific value from the body we need this json
object
to verify the specific value of the key in response body, we need json
object
NOTE: we can verify the values and keys without json as well, but if
client is needed we need to write functions/method to perform some
additional verification
pre- request scripts can also be written under test as having one place to
write all types of functions is easy to maintain
sometimes, we get ready made snippet from the postman, however sometimes,
we need to write specific functions to fulfill the requirement
pm.expect is the method you use to verify any property/attribute/key/value
from the response
Task -
Write a test
IN GENERATE TOKEN REQUEST, PLEASE WRITE THESE TESTS
verify the status code is 200
print the body of the response in json format
verify the body containes key 'token'
pm.expect - to verify
function() - to specify the method in java
pm.test - to write the test
pm.test("printing the response json body", function(){
const jsonFormat = JSON.parse(responseBody)
console.log(jsonFormat)
})
console.log - to print something in the console
const - it is a variable which is used to store values
"name" - it is used to provide function name
pm.test("Our batch 14 own function", function () {
pm.response.to.have.status("OK");
});
pm.test("Verifying the response", function(){
pm.expect(pm.response.text()).to.include("token");
})
REST Assured -
Rest assured is a DSL (Domain specific language)
it is a java library used to automate API's
Rest assured follows behavioral driven development BDD
in cucumber
Given - pre condition
When - perform actions
Then - expected output/ assertions/ verifications
in rest assured API
given - prepare the request
when - making the request/sending the request/ hitting the endpoint
then - verfying/assertions/expected results
rest web service allows us to send/receive data in json format which
contains key value pair

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 6

Recap -


	how to write our own function in postman -

	pm - postman
	test - to perform assertions


pm.expect - validation/verification

JSON - const abc = JSON.parse(responseBody)


Automation of API - we use cucumberBatch14 project for this (NOTE: WE DONT USE GROUP PROJECT IN THE CLASS)



rest assured -
another library http client

supports BDD approach -

given - prepare request
when - to hit the end point
then - verifying the response


base URI = base uri

Hamcrest matchers ---> it is a class that contains methods to perform assertions

JsonPath - this is a class
jsonPath() - this is a function/method belongs to JsonPath class

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 7

recap --
    Rest Assured API -
    DSL - domain specific language
    it allows us to send/receive data in json format

    base uri = base url

    rest assured api follows BDD approach
    given - to prepare the request
    when - send the request / hitting the end point
    then - assertion / verification

    to prepare the request -
    RequestSpecification -  we use to prepare the request
    Response - to store the response body after hitting the end point

    along with given, we provide headers, query parameters, body etc. to prepare
    the request as per the type of method (GET, POST)

    JSONPath - class
    jsonPath() - to provide the functionality of assertions

    Hamcrest matchers - for assertions we use

    we use @Test annotation from jUnit to run all the test cases but,
    to execute them alphabetically, we use FixMethodOrder.

    C - created the employee
    R - retrieved the created employee
    U - updated the employee
    R - retrieved updated employee
    D - we didnt use it


    under steps package, we have hooks, when we write our steps for API under it,
    hooks will execute, we don't want to execute hooks for aPI since hooks are for API

    in generate token steps class, we have written the method for generating the token


    Class 8 -

    recap --
    -integrated (added) rest assured with cucumber
    -to add rest assured we added feature file
    -then API steps package, we don't want to execute hooks
    -to generate token automatically everytime, we implemented a class
    -API runner class to run only API test cases
    -API constant class to pass all the constants of the API
    -API Payload constant class to pass the body/payload


    NOW LETS TALK ABOUT OPERATIONS:::::::::::::

    C - We wrote a scenario for creating an employee and verify it
    R - retrieve the created employee and verify it
    U - update the employee and verify it
    D -


    AFTER PERFORMING THE OPERATIONS - we identified one more need to pass body/payload in easy format,
    so we implemented JSON format in APIPayloadConstant class

    HOMEWORK ----
    update the existing employee details and verify the data
