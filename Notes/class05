runner class - to run our test cases as per the requirement
                to generate missing steps
                to print the steps into the console
                to generate the report

page object model - it is a design pattern to have organised code and easy to maintain structure
                    according to it, we create separate class (page) according to the screens available
                    in the application and keep all the locators of this page in it.

Hooks - we write pre condition adn post condition using hooks in cucumber
@Before - pre condition needs to be mentioned in this
@After - post condition needs to be mentioned in this

Rules - Hooks class must be created inside steps package

Background - it is applicable only for one feature file
             it means for every feature file background will be different
             steps which are common among all the scenarios of that feature file will be taken into background
             but make sure the flow is not BROKEN.
             if the flow breaks, then we CANNOT take steps in background after that.


Hooks VS Background

Hooks are applicable for whole project(for all the feature files)
Background is applicable for one feture file nd varies from file to file
First Hooks execute then background execute then scenario execute
