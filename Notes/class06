 Page object model with page initializer class
        in this initializer class, we initialize all the objects of page classes and
        call the method in common methods class in openbrowser method

    We created a collection point in steps classes -
    -- methods call from common method, locators call from respective page classes using
       object of that class

    Background - same steps in feature file among all the scenarios should be a part of it
    Hooks - Pre condition and Post condition for the entire project
    here we use 2 hooks - @Before and @After

    Parameterization testing
    -- we can one add employee using feature file - 'instead of passing hardcoded data,
    we pass values inside the scenario such as "abc" , "xyz" etc'

    -- to increase the scope of testing, we use data driven testing concept
    instead of scenario, we use scenario outline with examples table
    -- in examples table, we pass multiple data sets using keys and values


Data table -
     it allows us to pass multiple sets of data without executing background

Outline - Examples table - hooks and background execute every time as per the data set
Scenario - Data table - hooks and background execute just one time
